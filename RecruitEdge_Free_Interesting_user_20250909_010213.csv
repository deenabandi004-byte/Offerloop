I hope this note finds you well. My name is Nicholas Wittig, and I am a 2027 at University of Southern California (USC) majoring in Marketing. While researching google, I was particularly impressed by your work on Google's AI integration across products.

Would you be open to a short call or Zoom meeting at your convenience? I'd greatly value hearing about your career journey and what drew you to google and any advice you might offer to someone preparing to enter the industry.

Warm regards,
Nicholas Wittig"
